# üëã Hello to all the Students and Developers.

<p align="justify">In this GitHub repository, you can find the biggest project I have worked on so far, in collaboration with my school, Fondazione Ikaros, and ArtGlobal. It was a challenging but interesting project that taught me a lot of new things about web development, design, and programming.</p>

<p align="justify">The project was developed using different languages, frameworks and tools:</p>

# ‚òï Fondazione Ikaros Bar

<p align="justify">It is a web application created by Vinay Rathour and ArtGlobal to simplify the process of ordering food from the school's bar and paying online. It was created to avoid confusion, fraud, scams, and other similar issues. The development started in late October and was completed by the end of February.</p>

<p align="justify">The website itself is very secure and well-designed, and it looks great on any screen size, whether it's a desktop or a smartphone.</p>

<p align="justify">It hosts many pages, three of which are public (i.e., anyone can view them), while others (whose exact number I don't remember) are private, meaning you can only access them through your account by logging in.</p>

<p align="justify">Unfortunately, I can't give away too many spoilers, dear friends :3</p>

<p align="justify">But I invite you to visit it at least once, simply by clicking on this link: <a href="https://ikarosbar.artglobaltech.com/" style="color: black;">Fondazione Ikaros - Bar</a></p>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
